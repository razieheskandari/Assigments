# Automatic Exploit Generation
AEG is the first system which addressed the problem of automatically generating exploits. It is implemented for four types of exploits (stack overflow vs. format string, return-to-stack vs. return-to-libc).

Exploit generation problem could not be built upon only static analysis at the source code level, since low-level runtime information such as memory addresses and stack frames should be considered. Also, the dynamic analysis at the binary level could not solely be used due to its lack of scalability, since no abstract level information about variables, buffers, functions and so on are available at the run-time in the binary level analysis.  Hence, a complete solution should combine both approaches. AEG carries out this by performing the following three high-level steps, as it shown in the Figure 1:

	1-  AEG Takes the source code and a safety property (for instance, a sample safety property check returns true if the address of accessing buffer occurs within the bounds of it, otherwise returns false). Finding the bugs is carried out by exploring the execution paths by analyzing the source code by utilizing a symbolic execution approach.  In this approach, a symbolic variable is used for inputs instead of concrete values and an expression containing those symbolic variables are generated for each execution path. 

	AEG utilized the KLEE as its symbolic executor. However, to avoid the infinite number of path enumeration, AEG provided a mechanism to select more exploitable paths first by introducing pre-conditional symbolic execution. There are three novel pre-conditional symbolic executions introduced, in addition to NONE (null) precondition, which is equivalent to normal traditional symbolic execution. These new pre-conditions are:
	
		a) The length pre-condition which defines the length of input and is determined by static analysis. 
		
		b) The known prefix of input which could be suitable when specific values trigger a bug (i.e., specific value for header field of HTTP or IP) 
		
		c) The concolic pre-condition in which all concrete inputs are determined for a bug instance. This sample concrete input may be a proof-of-concept that just causes the program to crash, but could not exploit it. 
		
While limiting the search space, by applying pre-conditions to symbolic execution, AEG performs a heuristic method for path prioritization. This novel heuristic helps AEG to prioritize buggy-path and loop exhaustion (i.e., the paths with the maximum number of loop iterations). A buggy-path is defined as a path that encounters an error or a bug, which is more likely to have other bugs, hence more prone to be exploited. For example, the path, that contains an off-by-one-error (i.e., incorrect memory bound definition for a buffer which is used in str-cpy), is considered as a buggy-path. The result of this step is an expression describing bug conditions ?bug and some information about vulnerable functions, buffers, etc (i.e., name of buffer B which cause a buffer overflow or format string, the name of function surrounding this buffer F and so on.) which are represented by V.  

	2-The second high-level step utilizes dynamic binary analysis and takes the bug predicate ?bug , the program executable and V. First, it extracts low-level runtime information R (i.e., the address of B, return address of F, run-time stack memory layout, so on). Then, AEG utilizes a constraint solver to find an exploit. 

	3- For each supported exploit type, AEG generates the exploit predicate ?exploit, which is used in conjunction with bug predicate ?bug in order to produce the final constraint. 

The exploit-generation step utilizes a shellcode database to examine all possible useful shellcodes. However, exploits are not robust to memory layout changing or to other small changes even to the change in the path of program execution. Hence, a verification step is added to check the reliability of the generated exploit by verifying whether the control-flow hijacking occurs. 

If the exploit is not successful in spawning a shell (local or remote shell), the exploit generation step (step 3) will run again to select a different shell-code or a different constraint. This step also could be repeated even if a successful exploit was found, in order to generate other exploit variants.

# Conclusion & Future Work: 

As the experiments shows, AEG can quickly generate real-world exploits (even zero-day ones) which could spawn a shell. 

	-Handling some other types of vulnerabilities such as heap overflow and integer overflow could be characterized by a safety property and could be done by AEG framework as future work, if the challenge of handling memory layout can be overcome. However, some other vulnerabilities such as timing attacks against crypto could not be formulated and handled with AEG architecture. 
	
	- Some other future works are considered as engineering matters to handle dynamic memory layout, address space layout randomization, support for other environments (i.e., other OS, compiler and so on).
